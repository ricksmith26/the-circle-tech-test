# Introduction and thank you

Recruitment is a two way thing.  You've got to like us and what we're all about, and we have to make sure you have the qualities we are looking for in spades.  All too often recruitment processes are pretty abstract and don't relate well to the day-to-day roles that are being recruited for.  Therefore we decided to make this technical challenge super realistic.

When we build new products, or try new tools, we build proof of concepts (POC's).  These POC's allow us to hit the ground running and put functionality into our customers hands really quickly.  They also give us an amazing opportunity to learn, try and measure new things.

The codebase that we are sharing with you is a POC for a new tool that we are building to measure employee feedback.  It has been built by one engineer who has experience with AWS, has played with GO on and off for a couple of months, has one years experience with javascript and has been learning React in their own time for the past six months.  This developer likely has less practical experience than you.

The purpose of the POC is to work out:

* Can we build systems that avoid databases?  Previously scaling databases has been a problem, so can we build systems that don't use them?  What trade-offs does this give?

* Is this tool actually useful?  Will our team love it?  Will it give us interesting actionable data?  If so can we incorporate it into our SAAS product?

By taking on this challenge we would like you to:

* Install the stack into AWS.  Don't worry - it's serverless so it won't cost the earth!

* Understand the architecture and tell us about the trade offs.  Do you love it, hate it, or are you somewhere in the middle?  We'd love to know?  Write us a document that gets your thoughts down on paper.

* Could we have done a better job with the code or documentation?  If so let us know in your document?

* This programming challenge is based on tasks that you would be expected to run with on a day to day basis.  There is at least one bug in the code that took our CTO three hours to find.  Can you fix it more quickly than him?  In addition, there is so much that can be improved in every tier of the application.  We would like you to impress us by making as many improvements as you see fit.  Throughout the codebase you will see lots of README.md files.  We recommend that you take a look at them, as they will explain how to install the app and give you a few hints about how it can be made better.

Once you are done we would appreciate you checking your response into github and sending us a link to the repo so that we can see what you've been up to!

We hope that you enjoy this challenge, and look forward to receiving your response.  Rest assured, we understand the commitment that you are undertaking. We have spent a lot of time preparing this challenge, and will put a lot of effort into reviewing what we get back.

Good Luck!!
