/**
 * A hardcoded feedback survey.
 * 
 * One of the next tasks is to build a back-end that loads this data from a lambda via the api gateway.
 * 
 * However, this gives a good example of what a feedback survey could look like.
 * 
 * Each question has a type, text, optional next question and one or more answers that themselves can lead on to another question.
